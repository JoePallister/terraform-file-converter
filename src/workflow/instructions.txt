Copied workflows/test-and-deployment.yml, Makefile and file-converter from previous repo.

Ran git init. Made new repo (on site). 

Set git origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/JoePallister/terraform-file-converter

git add, commit and push to set up.

Renamed the workflows folder to workflow, to stop it working, need to fix this.
