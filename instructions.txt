Copied workflows/test-and-deployment.yml, Makefile and file-converter from previous repo.

Ran git init. Made new repo (on site). 

Set git origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/JoePallister/terraform-file-converter

git add, commit and push to set up. 

Added secret keys to github secrets (found in hidden .aws folder)

To terraform folder: 

added s3 file making 3 buckets, added data zipping the lambda, added the zipped as a resource (1). 

added lambda file making the lambda function. This references the lambda resource in (1)

To fix:

test folder was just copied, just has tests from before.
