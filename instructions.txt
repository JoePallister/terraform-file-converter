Copied workflows/test-and-deployment.yml, Makefile and file-converter from previous repo.

Ran git init. Made new repo (on site). 

Set git origin

git remote add origin https://github.com/JoePallister/terraform-file-converter

git add, commit and push to set up. 


!!!!!!
Renamed the workflows folder to workflow, to stop it working, need to fix this.


Added secret keys to github secrets (found in hidden .aws folder)

To fix:

test folder was just copied, just has tests from before.
